Short project description

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory with the following environment variables:

   ```
   API_PORT=3000
   MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@your-cluster.mongodb.net/your-database?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   TOKEN_KEY=your-secret-key
   ```

   - `API_PORT`: The port number on which the API will run (e.g., 3000).
   - `MONGO_URI`: The connection URI for your MongoDB database. Replace `username`, `password`, `your-cluster`, and `your-database` with your actual MongoDB credentials and database information.
   - `TOKEN_KEY`: A secret key used for token generation and validation. You can choose any random string as your secret key.

   Note: Ensure that the `.env` file is not committed to version control and keep your actual sensitive information private.

4. Start the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
